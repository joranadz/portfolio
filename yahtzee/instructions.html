    <h1>Yahtzee playing intructions</h1>
    <p>The game consists of a number of rounds. In each round, a player gets
        three rolls of the dice, although they can choose to end their turn
        after one or two rolls. After the first roll the player can save any
        dice they want and re-roll the other dice. This procedure is repeated
        after the second roll. The player has complete choice as to which
        dice to roll. They can re-roll a die for the third roll that was
        not rolled on the second roll. The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13
        different category boxes and in each round, after the third roll,
        the player must choose one of these categories. The score entered
        in the box depends on how well the five dice match the scoring rule
        for the category. Details of the scoring rules for each category
        are given below. As an example, one of the categories is called
        Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category means that a
        player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the
        same value. The game is completed after 13 rounds by each player,
        with each of the 13 boxes filled. The total score is calculated
        by summing all thirteen boxes, together with any bonuses</p>
    <p>In the upper section there are six boxes. The score in each of these
        boxes is determined by adding the total number of dice matching
        that box. If a player scores a total of 63 or more points in these six
        boxes, a bonus of 35 is added to the upper section score. Although
        63 points corresponds to scoring exactly three-of-a-kind for each
        of the six boxes, a common way to get the bonus is by scoring
        four-of-a-kind for some numbers so that fewer of other numbers
        are needed. A player can earn the bonus even if they score a "0"
        in an upper section box.</p>
    <p>The lower section contains a number of poker-themed categories with
        specific point values:</p>
    <p>Three Of A Kind (At least three dice the same) Points: Sum of all dice.</p>
    <p>Four Of A Kind (At least four dice the same )Points: Sum of all dice.</p>
    <p>Full House (Three of one number and two of another) Points: 	25.</p>
    <p> Small Straight	Four sequential dice(1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, or 3-4-5-6) Points: 	30.</p>
    <p>Large Straight	Five sequential dice(1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6)
        Points: 40.</p>
    <p>Yahtzee	(All five dice the same) Points:	50.</p>
    <p>Chance	(Any combination) Points: Sum of all dice.</p>
    <p>End of the game thentThe player with the highest grand total at the end
        of all 13 rounds is the winner.</p>
